            <p className="muted" style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
              ePrescience (formerly VerbaLearn) is an all-in-one learning suite inspired by and born out of 
              frustrations with existing study tools. The app simplifies the modern &quot;study stack&quot; into a 
              single, faster workflow that gives students their time back.

            <p className="muted" style={{ marginBottom: 16 }}>
              Built by Rory Monaghan as a solo full-stack developer in 2025, then partnering with Nick & Lex 
              to incorporate and build the company into a world-class software development powerhouse with 
              dedicated teams for testing, marketing, cross-platform development, database management, and 
              legal compliance.

              Our approach blends hands-on product engineering with a deep interest in how people actually
